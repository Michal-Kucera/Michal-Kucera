# Hi from Michal Kucera! 🙌

As a Software Architect 👷‍♂️, currently located in Barcelona 🏖️, I've been helping Fintech companies with architecting, developing and maintaining large-scale, highly-available, distributed digital payment applications, as well as integrating them with 3rd party banking systems.

# What banking systems have I worked with? 🏦

# What do I do in my leisure time? 🏖️

I love to hang up with friends 🍕 🍻, talk to new people, discover new destinations ✈️, hike ⛰️, snowboard 🏂, but also watch movies/series, listen to podcasts, read a nice book 📖, or attend conferences (e.g. [Spring I/O](https://springio.net)) 📈.

\* yet, some of the aforementioned activities are slightly complicated due to Covid 😮‍💨
